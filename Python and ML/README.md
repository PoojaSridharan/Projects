# Personalized Movie & TV Show Recommender
## Business Case

In the ever-expanding world of digital content, users frequently face an overwhelming number of choices. This recommendation system is designed to simplify decision-making and enhance user experience by providing personalized movie and TV show recommendations. With practical applications in the media and entertainment industry, this project serves to:

**Increase User Retention:** By aligning content suggestions with user preferences, the system encourages ongoing platform engagement.

**Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Precise recommendations reduce the time users spend searching for content.

**Drive Viewer Engagement:** Relevant recommendations lead to more watch time and boost customer loyalty, supporting subscription renewals.
The system can be valuable for streaming services, content curation platforms, and media apps by supporting data-driven decisions in content management and marketing.

## Project Overview
This project employs a clustering-based recommendation engine to suggest movies and TV shows to users based on genre, type, and country preferences. Using various machine learning techniques, the system identifies patterns in user interests and tailors recommendations for a personalized experience.

## How It Works
**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed movie and TV show data, encoding features such as genre, type, and country for effective use in modeling.

**Clustering and Feature Engineering:** Applied clustering techniques to segment movies and shows into groups with shared attributes, enhancing recommendation relevance.

**Recommendation Generation:** Utilized cosine similarity within clusters to generate personalized recommendations, ensuring high precision and relevance.
## Tools Used
**Programming Languages:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for trend and country-wise analysis
## Key Project Steps

**1. Data Preprocessing**

Cleaned data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
Encoded categorical variables, such as genres, types, and countries, to make them usable in the machine learning pipeline.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**

Analyzed relationships between movie ratings and votes.
Conducted trend analysis over time to examine the rise and fall of movie and TV show production.
Explored country-specific insights into genre preferences and media consumption.

**3. Clustering Analysis**

Clustered the dataset into groups based on genre, type, and region.
Developed a feature set from encoded genres and types to identify patterns in user content preferences.

**4. Building the Recommendation Engine**

Created a pivot table to represent each title's features in the dataset.
Calculated cosine similarity scores within clusters to find and rank similar content for each title.
Generated personalized recommendations for users based on similar titles within their preferred cluster.
## Key Takeaways
**Enhanced Recommendation Precision:** By narrowing down recommendations within specific clusters, the model provides relevant content suggestions tailored to user interests.

**Scalable Approach:** The methodology can adapt to a wide range of datasets and incorporate additional features like viewer ratings or content release dates.

**Practical Applications:** The system offers insights for content streaming platforms to optimize their recommendation algorithms and improve user satisfaction.
## Future Enhancements
**User Feedback Integration:** Implement a feedback loop to refine recommendations over time based on user interactions.

**Content-based Filtering Enhancements:** Add additional features like cast, director, and storyline keywords to improve recommendation accuracy.

**Real-Time Recommendations:** Integrate real-time data streaming to offer up-to-date recommendations based on current user behavior.
